# Level 2

The level goal is to find a file called "spaces in this filename"

Don't tell me this is going to try to trick me with spaces in filename so without quotes it won't work...

```console
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat "spaces in this filename"
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
```

sigh...

```console
zjjc123@kali:~$ ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

That was easy...
